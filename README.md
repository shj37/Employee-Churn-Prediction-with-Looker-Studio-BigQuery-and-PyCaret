![project overview](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*ynsvhf16H-NJyj2coTvX8A.jpeg)

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation of an employee churn prediction pipeline using Google **BigQuery**, **PyCaret**, and **Looker Studio**. The goal is to predict which employees might leave based on historical data and offer insights to boost retention.

## Technologies Used

- **Google BigQuery**: For scalable data storage and processing.
- **PyCaret**: For automated machine learning model development.
- **Looker Studio**: For creating interactive data visualizations.

## Key Features

- Data ingestion and preparation using BigQuery.
- Automated model selection and tuning with PyCaret.
- Interactive dashboard creation with Looker Studio.
- Identification of key factors influencing employee churn.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Google Cloud project and enable BigQuery.
3. Upload the provided datasets to BigQuery.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and generate predictions.
5. Use Looker Studio to create and share the dashboard.
